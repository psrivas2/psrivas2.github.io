Hello,

I am a final year doctoral student under [Prof. Vikram Adve](http://vikram.cs.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am supposedly an expert in compilers for heterogeneous systems and machine learning acclerators. I am looking forward to my next position as a Research Scientist at x (currently working on getting its value). The time spent here at UIUC has, among other things, yielded some academic [results](publications.md).

Some of the projects that I really liked working on include HPVM, PROMISE. More details can be found [here](projects.md), or even better, you can email me at [psrivas2@illinois.edu](mailto:psrivas2@illinois.edu).
