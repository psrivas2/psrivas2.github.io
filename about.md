Welcome! I am a compiler researcher who is working on
* Mainstreaming novel machine learning architectures and memory technologies
* Making Heterogenous Systems easier to program by increasing code and performance portability of applications
* Focus on deep learning to address the computation challenges so that the community can continue to do the awesome research they are doing!

### And ...

* I also spend plenty of time (probably more than what is healthy for my research) with deep learning projects, paper, lectures :)
